### 🔧 SHA-1 Fingerprint (For Google Sign-In on Android)

```
SHA1: C5:E9:34:FE:0B:69:02:D3:DA:5E:EB:7E:E8:3D:B8:A9:C2:F4:51:32
```

**Important**: Add this SHA-1 to Firebase Console for Google Sign-In to work on Android:
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/farms-2025/settings/general
2. Scroll to **Your apps** → Select your Android app
3. Click **Add fingerprint**
4. Paste the SHA-1 above
5. Click **Save**

### 📱 How to Run

#### Option 1: Physical Android Device (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Enable USB debugging on your phone
# 2. Connect via USB
# 3. Run:
flutter devices  # Verify device is detected
flutter run
```

#### Option 2: Android Emulator (After Fixing KVM)
```bash
# Fix KVM permissions (one-time setup):
sudo gpasswd -a $USER kvm
newgrp kvm

# Launch emulator and run:
flutter emulators --launch Pixel_8
flutter run
```

#### Option 3: Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open project: `/var/projects/flutter/farms`
3. Start an emulator from AVD Manager
4. Click the **Run** button (▶️)

#### Option 4: iOS Device/Simulator
```bash
# If you have a Mac with Xcode:
flutter run -d ios
```

### ⚙️ Final Firebase Console Setup

Before testing authentication, ensure these are enabled in Firebase Console:

1. **Enable Authentication Methods**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/farms-2025/authentication/providers
   - ✅ Enable **Email/Password**
   - ✅ Enable **Google**
   - ⚪ Enable **Facebook** (optional)

2. **Add SHA-1 Fingerprint** (see above)

3. **Verify Firestore Database**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/farms-2025/firestore
   - Ensure database is created (Cloud Firestore)

### 🧪 Testing Checklist

Once running on a device, test these features:

- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] Login screen appears
- [ ] Email/password registration works
- [ ] Email/password login works
- [ ] Form validation shows errors correctly
- [ ] Google Sign-In button appears
- [ ] Google Sign-In works (after adding SHA-1)
- [ ] Forgot password sends email
- [ ] User data saves to Firestore
- [ ] Sign out works

### ❌ Why Chrome/Linux Don't Work

- **Chrome in WSL2**: GUI apps in WSL2 have limited browser support
- **Linux Desktop**: Firebase isn't configured for Linux (not a target platform)
- **Solution**: Use Android/iOS devices as intended
