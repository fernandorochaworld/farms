4. Use checklists in each step to track progress

## 📊 System Overview

### Core Entities
- **Farm** - Main farm entity with capacity
- **Person** - Farm personnel with roles (Owner, Manager, Worker, Arrendatario)
- **Cattle Lot** - Groups of cattle tracked together
- **Transaction** - Buy, Sell, Move, Die operations
- **Weight History** - Average weight tracking per lot
- **Goal** - Performance targets
- **Service History** - Farm maintenance and services

### Key Features
- Multi-farm management
- Real-time dashboard
- Cattle type classification (Bezerro, Novilho, Boi 3/4/5+ anos)
- Automatic quantity calculations
- Financial tracking
- Weight progression and ADG
- Goal tracking with notifications
- Comprehensive reports with PDF/CSV export
- Role-based permissions

## 🔐 Person Types & Permissions

| Person Type | Key Permissions |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Owner** | Full control over farm |
| **Manager** | Manage operations, lots, transactions |
| **Worker** | Add transactions, basic lot operations |
| **Arrendatario** | Limited access, view and add transactions |

**Admin flag** can override restrictions for any person type.

## 📈 Transaction Types

1. **Buy** - Purchase cattle, increases lot quantity
2. **Sell** - Sell cattle, decreases lot quantity
3. **Move** - Transfer between lots (creates two linked transactions)
4. **Die** - Record mortality, decreases lot quantity

## 🔢 Cattle Age Classification

- **Bezerro** - Up to 1 year
- **Novilho** - Up to 2 years
- **Boi 3 anos** - Up to 3 years
- **Boi 4 anos** - Up to 4 years
- **Boi 5+ anos** - 5 years or more

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

Each step requires:
- Unit tests for models (serialization, validation)
- Unit tests for repositories
- Unit tests for services/business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complete flows
- **Target: >70% code coverage**
