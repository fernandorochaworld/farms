- Events: Load, Create, Update, Delete
- Bloc implementation with repository injection

### Repository Pattern
All steps follow:
- Interface definition
- Firebase implementation
- Error handling
- Real-time updates (streams)

### UI Pattern
All steps include:
- List screen
- Details screen
- Create/Edit form screen
- Confirmation dialogs
- Empty states
- Loading states

### Testing Pattern
All steps include:
- Model serialization tests
- Repository method tests
- Bloc state transition tests
- Widget rendering tests
- Integration flow tests
